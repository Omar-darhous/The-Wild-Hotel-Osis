# The Wild Hotel

A modern single-page admin/dashboard application for managing a small hotel (The Wild Hotel). Built with React and Vite, the app provides features for booking management, cabins, guest data, check-in/out, reporting, user authentication, and site settings. It integrates with Supabase for backend services and is prepared for static hosting (Netlify).

## Project status

Prototype / production-ready admin UI (depends on backend configuration). This repository contains the frontend application and client-side integration with Supabase.

  - `features/` — feature modules (auth, bookings, cabins, check-in/out, dashboard, settings)
  - `services/` — API wrappers and `supabase` client
  - `ui/` — shared UI components (buttons, forms, tables, etc.)
  - `pages/` — route pages
  - `styles/` — global styles and theming
  - `context/` — React contexts (e.g., dark mode)

## Setup & run

Prerequisites

- Node.js (recommend v18+)
- npm (or yarn/pnpm if you prefer; scripts assume npm)

Install dependencies

```powershell
# from repository root
npm install
```

Development server

```powershell
npm run dev
```

Build for production

```powershell
npm run build
```

Preview production build locally

```powershell
npm run preview
```

## Environment variables

The app integrates with Supabase. Create a `.env` file (or set system environment variables) with the values required by `services/supabase.js`. Typical variables:

- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` — your Supabase project URL
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` — your Supabase anon/public key

Notes: Vite requires env variables used in client code to be prefixed with `VITE_`.
